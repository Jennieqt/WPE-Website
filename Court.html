        This activity was much more to me than<br> just a Spectator, I was watching my father<br> played against the alumniof the <br>Silliman University. I expected
        this activity to be<br> great and I wasn't wrong. I really<br> enjoy watching my Dad and his<br> teammates play the game.<br> My father taught<br> me how to play Basketball<br>
        and he is my inspiration to<br> become much better everyday.<br><br>I saw the benefit of this activity, I got inspired<br> and got some motivation to improve myself<br>
        from the game. Because of this activity,<br> I am much confident on my skills rather <br>than just be shy and not play at all.<br> I learned how to train my body well
        and<br> how I need to get out of comfort zones to<br> reach the goal that I want in terms<br> of academically and physically.</p>
    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div2">11/23/22(7:00pm)<br>SUMVT College vs COSCA College!<br>Silliman University<br>Spectator<br><br>
        During this activity, I watched as the SUMVT College<br> fought against COSCA college. I expected<br> this activity to be exciting, even though I don't<br>
        know much about Volleyball, I still got excited<br> because of how thrill the game was. Both teams<br> played it very well and non of the team gave up.<br><br>
        The benefit I got on this activity was to<br> work really hard so that my idols would<br> become my rivals someday.<br> Because of this activity, I am now a much<br>
        more hardworking person than I was yesterday.<br> I learned to now give up the moment things become<br> hard and just keep on moving forward no matter<br>
        what happens. Because<br> all of it will eventually be worth it in the end.</p>

        During this day, we got together with my team. I expected this day to be hard but yet fun. I was very nervous at first because
        I have a hobbit of getting nervous in crucial times. We were all having fun and even though we lost to our opposing team, we still had a
        good run in the Tournament. I learned from this activity that even if you lose, as long as you're giving it your all and have fun while playing,
        it would all be good. Because of this activity, I am happier than I was yesterday. I get to meet some new friends in the Silliman especially that I'm
        still new to the school. We built friendship through the Tournament even if we lost.
