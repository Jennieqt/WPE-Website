        During this activity we prepared some white<br> gifts for the Orphanage. I expected this<br> activity to be fun and feels good in<br> the heart to give to other people.
        And it was<br> really fun and it really felt good<br> to be able to help in the little<br>things that we know. The benefit I got from<br> this activity is that I learned to<br>
        also share my blessings from other<br> people who is having a hard time<br> in their lives.<br><br> Because of this activity, I am thankful<br> to what I have in my life.<br> I learned
        to be contented with the<br> things that I currently have and<br> learned how to count my blessings.<br> Let us all be nice to each other as we<br> all don't know what a person
        is going<br> through with their lives. If we<br> have something that can help them,<br> let us not hesitate to do it because<br> we may be the blessings that they prayed for.

        During this activity, I was a<br> participant. I expected this activity<br> to
        be hard because I'm a really<br> shy person and I don't like to be<br> in a group.
        I was yet again wrong,<br> I was thankful I participated<br> in this activity
        because of how it tackles<br> about us during the pandemic.<br><br> The benefit of this
        activity was that<br> I was able to express my unsaid<br> thoughts and I got to share
        the tough<br> times I had to go through during<br> the pandemic. Because of this
        activity,<br> I am free from my sadness during<br> the pandemic. The heavy burden
        I carried<br> was lighten and I couldn't<br> be much more thankful.</p>

       During this activity, I was a Participant.<br> I expected this activity to be<br> fun because I was with my friends and<br> indeed it was fun and at the same time<br>
       it was scary. Because we had to to<br> perform something from our department<br> as to showcase our CCS department.<br> But it was really fun being there and got<br>
       to participate the activity. The benefit<br> I got from this activity is that I got out<br> once again from my comfort zone and went<br> on to do things outside of it.
       I had fun<br> and didn't regret doing so. Because of<br> this activity, I am much more confident on<br> how I am as a person and not too<br> shy about the things I lack.

        During this activity I had expected this<br> activity to be really fun. It was my dream to be<br> here in Silliman University and attend the University<br> Acquaintance Party.
        I indeed had one of<br> the most memorable day of my life, I got<br> to be with my friends and met some new friends<br> from Silliman.<br> I can continue to be in this environment<br>
        by attending the hibalag every school year.<br> It's really memorable and it would<br> be such a waste if we'll miss it.<br> The benefit of this activity was that<br> I got to socialize
        with my friends<br> and other people whom I still don't know.<br> because of this activity, I am now<br> much more confident on the way I am.<br> I was able to overcome my fear
        of being<br> around with so many people whom I still don't know.
